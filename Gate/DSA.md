### Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms: A Comprehensive Guide

This guide provides an overview of the fundamental concepts in programming, data structures, algorithms, and graph theory, focusing on Python implementation and basic algorithmic strategies.

---

## **1. Programming in Python**

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed, and interpreted programming language. It is easy to learn and has a clear syntax, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced programmers. Key aspects of Python programming include:

### **Basic Syntax**
- **Variables and Data Types**: Python supports dynamic typing, so variables do not require explicit type declarations.
  - Examples: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`.
  - Example: `x = 5`, `name = "John"`.
  
- **Control Structures**: 
  - Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
  - Loops: `for`, `while`.
  - Example: 
    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

- **Functions**:
  - Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    ```

- **Error Handling**: Python uses `try`, `except` blocks for exception handling.
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero")
    ```

## **2. Basic Data Structures**

Data structures organize and store data efficiently. Here's an overview of fundamental data structures:

### **Stacks**
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle.
- Operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `is_empty()`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    stack = []
    stack.append(10)  # push
    stack.pop()       # pop
    ```

### **Queues**
- A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle.
- Operations: `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `front()`, `is_empty()`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(10)  # enqueue
    queue.popleft()   # dequeue
    ```

### **Linked Lists**
- A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next element.
- Each node contains:
  - Data
  - A pointer to the next node (or `None` for the last node).
- Operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `search()`.
  - Example (Singly Linked List):
    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.data = data
            self.next = None

    class LinkedList:
        def __init__(self):
            self.head = None

        def append(self, data):
            new_node = Node(data)
            if not self.head:
                self.head = new_node
            else:
                last = self.head
                while last.next:
                    last = last.next
                last.next = new_node
    ```

### **Trees**
- A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root element and child elements.
- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A special type of binary tree where the left child is smaller, and the right child is larger than the parent.
- Operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `search()`, `inorder_traversal()`, `preorder_traversal()`, `postorder_traversal()`.
  - Example (Binary Search Tree):
    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, key):
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.value = key

    def insert(root, key):
        if root is None:
            return Node(key)
        if key < root.value:
            root.left = insert(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = insert(root.right, key)
        return root
    ```

### **Hash Tables**
- A hash table stores data using a hash function to map keys to values.
- Operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `search()`.
- Python's `dict` is an implementation of a hash table.
  - Example:
    ```python
    hash_table = {}
    hash_table["name"] = "Alice"
    print(hash_table["name"])  # Output: Alice
    ```

---

## **3. Search Algorithms**

### **Linear Search**
- Linear search scans each element in a list sequentially to find a target value.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def linear_search(arr, target):
      for i in range(len(arr)):
          if arr[i] == target:
              return i
      return -1
  ```

### **Binary Search**
- Binary search operates on a sorted array, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while low <= high:
          mid = (low + high) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              low = mid + 1
          else:
              high = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```

---

## **4. Sorting Algorithms**

### **Selection Sort**
- Selection sort divides the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def selection_sort(arr):
      for i in range(len(arr)):
          min_index = i
          for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
              if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                  min_index = j
          arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
  ```

### **Bubble Sort**
- Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
  ```

### **Insertion Sort**
- Insertion sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def insertion_sort(arr):
      for i in range(1, len(arr)):
          key = arr[i]
          j = i - 1
          while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
              arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
              j -= 1
          arr[j + 1] = key
  ```

---

## **5. Divide and Conquer Algorithms**

### **Merge Sort**
- Merge sort divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**.
- Example:
  ```python
  def merge_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) > 1:
          mid = len(arr) // 2
          left = arr[:mid]
          right = arr[mid:]

          merge_sort(left)
          merge_sort(right)

          i = j = k = 0
          while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
              if left[i] < right[j]:
                  arr[k] = left[i]
                  i += 1
              else:
                  arr[k] = right[j]
                  j += 1
              k += 1

          while i < len(left):
              arr[k] = left[i]
              i += 1
              k += 1

          while j < len(right):
              arr[k] = right[j]
              j += 1
              k += 1
  ```

### **Quick Sort**
- Quick sort selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot), and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- Time Complexity: **O(n log n)** average, **O(n²)** worst case.
- Example:
  ```python
  def quick_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) <= 1:
          return arr
      pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
      left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
      middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
      right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
      return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
  ```

## **6. Graph Theory and Algorithms**

### **Introduction to Graph Theory**
- A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
- Types of Graphs:
  - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction.
  - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have direction.
  - **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights or costs.

### **Basic Graph Algorithms**

#### **Traversals**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:

 Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
  - Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def dfs(graph, node, visited=set()):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    ```

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
  - Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from collections import deque
    def bfs(graph, start):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([start])
        visited.add(start)
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            print(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    ```

#### **Shortest Path Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
  - Time Complexity: **O(V²)** or **O(E log V)** with priority queues.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import heapq
    def dijkstra(graph, start):
        pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
        distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
        distances[start] = 0
        while pq:
            (dist, current_node) = heapq.heappop(pq)
            for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
                distance = dist + weight
                if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
        return distances
    ```

This guide introduces key concepts in Python programming, data structures, basic algorithms, and graph theory. Mastery of these topics will provide a strong foundation for both software development and algorithmic problem-solving.



Here are **lesser-known, often overlooked** facts about the topics of **programming, data structures, algorithms, and graph theory**. These are essential points that are often ignored by most learners and even some experienced developers, yet they can significantly impact the effectiveness of your code and problem-solving skills.

---

### **1. Programming in Python**
**1.1 Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**
- **Fact**: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a bottleneck in multi-threaded programs. This lock ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even in multi-core systems.
- **Impact**: For CPU-bound tasks, Python threading does not lead to performance improvements as it would in languages without a GIL (like Java or C++). You can use multi-processing instead of multi-threading to bypass the GIL and fully utilize multi-core processors.
- **How to mitigate**: Use the `multiprocessing` library to parallelize CPU-bound tasks.

**1.2 Python's Memory Management (Reference Counting)**
- **Fact**: Python uses **reference counting** as the primary memory management technique. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, Python automatically frees the memory.
- **Impact**: While reference counting is efficient in most cases, it has limitations, particularly when dealing with cyclic references. These cannot be freed immediately by reference counting, requiring Python's **cyclic garbage collector** to clean up memory.
- **How to mitigate**: Be mindful of circular references when designing data structures, and periodically call `gc.collect()` for critical systems.

**1.3 Mutable vs. Immutable Types**
- **Fact**: Python’s behavior with mutable and immutable types can lead to subtle bugs. For example, when you modify a mutable object inside a function (like a list or dictionary), it can change the original object outside the function.
- **Impact**: This can introduce **side-effects**, leading to hard-to-debug code, especially when using mutable objects as function arguments.
- **How to mitigate**: Use immutable types (tuples, strings) when possible, or make defensive copies of mutable objects when passing them around.

---

### **2. Data Structures**
**2.1 Amortized Analysis (Stack and Queue Operations)**
- **Fact**: While operations like **push** and **pop** on stacks or **enqueue** and **dequeue** on queues are **O(1)** in the worst case, the **amortized complexity** of these operations can sometimes vary, especially when resizing is involved (e.g., with dynamic arrays).
- **Impact**: Some dynamic data structures (like Python's `list`) resize automatically when the array grows, and this resizing can lead to occasional **O(n)** operations. However, over many operations, the cost becomes amortized to **O(1)**.
- **How to mitigate**: Be aware of resizing behavior and use the right data structures for specific use cases. For example, consider using **collections.deque** for efficient queue operations.

**2.2 Hash Collisions and Performance**
- **Fact**: A good hash table design minimizes collisions, but **hash collisions** are inevitable. When collisions happen, the hash table might degrade to a **linked list** in the worst case, making the search time **O(n)** instead of **O(1)**.
- **Impact**: With poor hash functions or too many collisions, hash tables can perform poorly. In Python, dictionaries automatically resize and rehash, but a poorly chosen key type can still cause inefficiencies.
- **How to mitigate**: Use well-distributed hash functions and ensure your keys are designed to minimize collisions. Python’s **tuple** is a better hash key than a list because tuples are immutable.

**2.3 Linked List Memory Usage**
- **Fact**: Linked lists consume extra memory per node due to the need to store a reference (pointer) to the next node in addition to the data.
- **Impact**: In cases where memory usage is critical (e.g., in embedded systems), a linked list can be inefficient. An array or dynamic array might use less memory, depending on the problem.
- **How to mitigate**: Be mindful of the memory overhead when choosing a linked list, and consider other data structures like **arrays** or **deque** when memory efficiency is important.

---

### **3. Algorithms**
**3.1 Worst-Case Complexity vs. Average-Case Complexity**
- **Fact**: Most algorithmic analyses focus on worst-case time complexity, but **average-case** performance can be more relevant in practice, especially for **randomized** algorithms.
- **Impact**: An algorithm with a high worst-case complexity might perform much better in typical use cases, but focusing only on the worst-case scenario can lead you to make poor choices.
- **How to mitigate**: Always consider **average-case performance** in addition to worst-case complexity, particularly when working with **randomized algorithms** or **data with inherent randomness** (e.g., quicksort).

**3.2 Space Complexity vs. Time Complexity**
- **Fact**: Many developers focus solely on time complexity when optimizing code, but space complexity is just as important. Algorithms that are **time-efficient** can still be inefficient in terms of space.
- **Impact**: Sometimes an algorithm with slightly higher time complexity might use much less memory, making it preferable in situations with limited memory resources.
- **How to mitigate**: Always analyze both **time** and **space** complexities, especially when working with large datasets or systems with constrained memory.

**3.3 In-place Algorithms and Stability**
- **Fact**: Many basic sorting algorithms, like **bubble sort** or **insertion sort**, are **in-place** (they don't use additional memory for sorting), but they may not be **stable** (they don't preserve the relative order of equal elements).
- **Impact**: Stability can be crucial in certain sorting tasks, like sorting a list of employees by name and then by age, where you want to maintain the order of people with the same name.
- **How to mitigate**: Consider **stable sorting algorithms** like **merge sort** or **timsort** (Python’s default sorting algorithm).

---

### **4. Graph Theory**
**4.1 Graph Representation: Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List**
- **Fact**: The choice between using an **adjacency matrix** and an **adjacency list** depends on the graph's **sparsity**.
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: Works well for dense graphs but uses **O(V²)** space.
  - **Adjacency List**: More space-efficient for sparse graphs, using **O(V + E)** space.
- **Impact**: For sparse graphs, using an adjacency matrix can lead to wasteful memory usage, and for dense graphs, an adjacency list can lead to performance degradation in certain graph algorithms.
- **How to mitigate**: Analyze the graph's **density** before deciding on the representation. Use **adjacency lists** for sparse graphs and **adjacency matrices** for dense graphs or when you need to quickly check the presence of edges.

**4.2 Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Negative Weights**
- **Fact**: Dijkstra's algorithm assumes **non-negative edge weights**. If negative weights are present, **Dijkstra's algorithm** will not work correctly, and you need to use **Bellman-Ford** instead.
- **Impact**: If you apply Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with negative weights, the algorithm will produce incorrect results.
- **How to mitigate**: Always check for negative weights in your graph before using Dijkstra’s algorithm. If negative weights are present, use **Bellman-Ford**, which handles negative weights but with a time complexity of **O(VE)**.

**4.3 Graph Connectivity and Directed vs. Undirected Graphs**
- **Fact**: Connectivity in **directed graphs** (where edges have a direction) differs significantly from **undirected graphs** (where edges have no direction). In undirected graphs, if there’s a path between any two vertices, they are considered **connected**. In directed graphs, connectivity can be more complex (you can have **strong** or **weak connectivity**).
- **Impact**: Ignoring the type of graph can lead to incorrect assumptions about its structure, especially when applying algorithms for tasks like **strongly connected components**.
- **How to mitigate**: Be clear about the type of graph you’re working with (directed or undirected) and the type of connectivity you need. Use algorithms like **Kosaraju’s algorithm** for finding strongly connected components in directed graphs.

**4.4 Graph Cycles and Performance**
- **Fact**: **Detecting cycles** in directed graphs is essential for certain algorithms (like **topological sorting**). Cycle detection can be done in **O(V + E)** time using DFS, but the performance and approach vary for directed and undirected graphs.
- **Impact**: Failing to properly detect cycles in a graph can lead to infinite loops, incorrect topological sorts, or other errors in graph-based algorithms.
- **How to mitigate**: Always consider cycle detection when performing tasks like **topological sorting** or working with directed graphs in general. Use **DFS** with backtracking to detect cycles efficiently.

---

### **Conclusion**
The above facts are commonly overlooked but have a **profound impact** on the design, efficiency, and correctness of your programs and algorithms. Ignoring these details can lead to performance bottlenecks, memory inefficiencies, and incorrect results, especially in complex systems or large-scale applications. By paying attention to these subtle aspects, you can make better decisions and write more efficient, robust, and scalable code.

### A Deep Understanding of Algorithmic Principles, Complexity Analysis, and Optimization

To excel in advanced programming exams and in real-world problem-solving, it’s essential to develop a **deep understanding of algorithmic principles**, the ability to **analyze complexity**, and the skill to **optimize solutions**. Here, we break down each area and explain the core concepts you should master.

---

### **1. Algorithmic Principles**
Understanding algorithmic principles involves grasping the core ideas that drive how algorithms work and how they are designed to solve specific problems efficiently.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Problem Decomposition**:
   - **Divide and Conquer**: This principle involves breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them independently, and then combining their results. It is the basis for algorithms like **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Binary Search**.
     - Example: **Merge Sort** splits the array in half recursively until the subarrays are trivially sorted, and then merges them back together in sorted order.

2. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - These algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Greedy algorithms are often faster and simpler but don’t always guarantee an optimal solution.
     - Example: **Kruskal’s Algorithm** for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) works by selecting the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle, iterating until all nodes are connected.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Dynamic programming is used when a problem can be broken down into overlapping sub-problems. It avoids redundant computations by storing results of sub-problems (memoization or tabulation).
     - Example: The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is solved using dynamic programming to store results of subproblems that are solved repeatedly in a naive recursive approach.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - Backtracking is a method of finding all (or some) solutions by trying to build a solution incrementally, and abandoning a partial solution as soon as it is determined that it cannot lead to a valid solution.
     - Example: **N-Queens Problem** is typically solved using backtracking by placing queens row-by-row and removing any placements that lead to conflicts.

5. **Randomized Algorithms**:
   - Randomized algorithms incorporate randomness to improve the performance or simplicity of an algorithm, often with a probabilistic guarantee of correctness.
     - Example: **Quicksort** is a randomized algorithm where the pivot selection is random, improving its performance by reducing the likelihood of worst-case time complexity.

### **2. Complexity Analysis**
Analyzing the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of algorithms allows you to understand how the algorithm behaves as the input size grows. This is crucial for choosing the right algorithm in real-world applications where time and space resources are limited.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Big O Notation (Worst-case complexity)**:
   - Big O notation describes the **upper bound** of an algorithm’s runtime as a function of the input size, representing the worst-case scenario.
     - Example: **Merge Sort** has a time complexity of **O(n log n)** in the worst case, meaning that its runtime increases logarithmically with the size of the input, scaled by a linear factor.

2. **Big Omega (Best-case complexity)**:
   - Big Omega describes the **lower bound** of an algorithm’s runtime, indicating the best possible performance (fastest) that can be achieved.
     - Example: **Binary Search** has a best-case time complexity of **O(1)** when the target value is found at the middle of the array.

3. **Big Theta (Exact complexity)**:
   - Big Theta provides a tight bound on the runtime, both from the upper and lower bounds. It defines the exact growth rate of the algorithm’s runtime with respect to the input size.
     - Example: **Insertion Sort** has **O(n²)** time complexity in the worst case, and **O(n)** in the best case (when the array is already sorted).

4. **Time Complexity Classes**:
   - **Constant Time**: **O(1)** – An operation that takes the same time regardless of input size, such as accessing an element in an array.
   - **Linear Time**: **O(n)** – The runtime increases linearly with the size of the input, such as traversing an array.
   - **Logarithmic Time**: **O(log n)** – The runtime increases logarithmically, common in algorithms like **Binary Search**.
   - **Quadratic Time**: **O(n²)** – Common in algorithms with nested loops, like **Bubble Sort** or **Selection Sort**.
   - **Exponential Time**: **O(2^n)** – Common in brute force solutions for NP-complete problems.

5. **Space Complexity**:
   - Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
     - Example: **Quick Sort** has a space complexity of **O(log n)** due to its recursive calls, while **Merge Sort** has **O(n)** space complexity because it requires additional space to store subarrays during the merge step.

### **3. Optimization**
Optimization is crucial in making sure that algorithms run efficiently, especially for large inputs or time-sensitive applications. It involves improving both **time complexity** and **space complexity**.

#### **Key Techniques for Optimization:**

1. **Precomputing Results (Memoization)**:
   - Store results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This is particularly effective in **Dynamic Programming**.
     - Example: The **Fibonacci sequence** can be computed much faster using memoization, where results of subproblems are stored in an array and reused.

2. **Using Efficient Data Structures**:
   - Choosing the right data structure can drastically improve performance. For example, using a **hash table** for **O(1)** average time complexity for lookups, or a **priority queue** for efficient retrieval of the minimum/maximum element.
     - Example: **Dijkstra's Algorithm** uses a **min-heap (priority queue)** to get the next node with the smallest tentative distance efficiently.

3. **Greedy Choices and Approximation Algorithms**:
   - In cases where exact optimization is computationally expensive or impossible (e.g., **NP-complete** problems), use greedy algorithms or approximation algorithms that yield near-optimal solutions in much less time.
     - Example: **Huffman Encoding** for lossless data compression is a greedy algorithm that produces near-optimal results.

4. **Pruning and Branch and Bound**:
   - In algorithms like backtracking or searching, prune the search space by eliminating paths that cannot possibly lead to a better solution.
     - Example: In the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, the **Branch and Bound** technique can be used to eliminate paths that exceed the current best-known path length.

5. **Parallelism and Concurrency**:
   - Split a problem into subproblems that can be solved concurrently or in parallel, utilizing modern multi-core processors. This is especially useful in algorithms like **Matrix Multiplication** and **MapReduce**.
     - Example: **MapReduce** algorithms can process massive datasets by dividing the work among multiple machines.

6. **Heuristics and Metaheuristics**:
   - **Heuristics** provide a shortcut to finding good enough solutions quickly for problems that are hard to solve optimally.
     - Example: **A* Search Algorithm** uses heuristics (like the Manhattan distance) to efficiently find the shortest path in a graph.
   - **Metaheuristics** like **Simulated Annealing**, **Genetic Algorithms**, and **Tabu Search** can be used for problems like optimization and scheduling where finding an optimal solution is too expensive.

### **Combining the Concepts**
An expert-level understanding involves **combining algorithmic principles, complexity analysis, and optimization techniques** to not only choose the right approach for a given problem but also refine the approach for efficiency. Here are some advanced scenarios where this combination is tested:

#### **Example Problems:**
1. **Optimal Matrix Chain Multiplication**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sequence of matrices, determine the optimal way to parenthesize them for matrix multiplication to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications.
   - **Algorithm**: Use **Dynamic Programming** to store intermediate results and avoid recomputation, and perform **complexity analysis** to ensure efficiency.
   - **Optimization**: Focus on **space complexity** by using only the necessary data to store the subproblem solutions.

2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm with Priority Queue**:
   - **Problem**: Find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
   - **Optimization**: Improve the **time complexity** by using a **min-heap (priority queue)** to extract the minimum distance node in **O(log n)** time.
   - **Complexity**: Understand that the time complexity of **Dijkstra’s algorithm** with a priority queue is **O((V + E) log V)**, and be able to **analyze** and **optimize** the space/time trade-offs.

3. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:
   - **Problem**: Find the shortest path that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
   - **Greedy vs Dynamic Programming**: Be able to **justify** when to use **dynamic programming** (e.g., Held-Karp Algorithm) for solving TSP exactly and when to apply **approximation algorithms** like **Christofides’ Algorithm**.
